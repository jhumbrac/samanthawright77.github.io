	<h2>About Me</h2>

	<p>My name is Samantha, but I prefer Sam (it definitely fits my personality best).  I’m originally from Reno, NV but have always moved from city to city since I was young. I have lived in Mammoth, Honolulu, San Francisco, and now Dallas, TX.  And I’ve got to say Dallas is an incredible city:  Great people, great food, awesome shopping, and gorgeous warm and sunny weather.</p> 

	<p>I’m passionate about all aspects of aesthetics from food and wine to design.  My dream is to pursue my love of the written word by writing my own novel.  The concept for the book is well underway and I cannot wait to share more about it as it comes to fruition.  Until that dream is realized, I’m just a hardworking woman trying to build a life for myself in this wonderful city.</p>

	<p>The short list of things I love includes: a great meal shared with friends and family, a fine glass of Napa Valley Pinot Noir, pizza (duh), Netflix binges (even though I’ve seen Legally Blonde a thousand times), and the great outdoors.  I love traveling to far off places and being outside in the sunshine.</p>
